2024-07-22\\nTitle: Attention Is All You Need But You Don't Need All Of It For Inference of Large Language Models\\nAuthors: Georgy Tyukin, Gbetondji J-S Dovonon, Jean Kaddour, Pasquale Minervini\\nSummary: The inference demand for LLMs has skyrocketed in recent months, and serving\\nmodels with low latencies remains challenging due to the quadratic input length\\ncomplexity of the attention layers. In this work, we investigate the effect of\\ndropping MLP and attention layers at inference time on the performance of\\nLlama-v2 models. We find that dropping dreeper attention layers only marginally\\ndecreases performance but leads to the best speedups alongside dropping entire\\nlayers. For example, removing 33\\\\% of attention layers in a 13B Llama2 model\\nresults in a 1.8\\\\% drop in average performance over the OpenLLM benchmark. We\\nalso observe that skipping layers except the latter layers reduces performances\\nfor more layers skipped, except for skipping the attention layers.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["wiki_tool.invoke(\"who is albert einstein\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":105},"id":"7TFZifVd7tIZ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1728031126515,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":630,"user":{"displayName":"SAURAB MISHRA IMS23323","userId":"16897900852261678834"}},"outputId":"36450bbf-4c3e-4725-8ad6-be520562174a"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"Page: Einstein family\\nSummary: The Einstein family is the family of physicist Albert Einstein (1879–1955). Einstein's great-great-great-great-grandfather, Jakob Weil, was his oldest recorded relative, born in the late 17th century, and the family continues to this day. Albert Einstein's great-great-grandfather, Löb Moses Sontheimer (1745–1831), was also the grandfather of the tenor Heinrich Sontheim (1820–1912) of Stuttgart.\\nAlbert's three children were from his relationship with his first wife, Mileva Marić, his daughter Lieserl being born a year before they married. Albert Einstein's second wife was Elsa Einstein, whose mother Fanny Koch was the sister of Albert's mother, and whose father, Rudolf Einstein, was the son of Raphael Einstein, a brother of Albert's paternal grandfather. Albert and Elsa were thus first cousins through their mothers and second cousins through their fathers.\\n\\n\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":6}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["tools=[wiki_tool]"],"metadata":{"id":"2kI4jw9l70Ag"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["##

It involves training a reward model to represent preferences, which can then be used to train other models through reinforcement learning.\n","In classical reinforcement learning, an intelligent agent's goal is to learn a function that guides its behavior, called a policy. This function is iteratively updated to maximize rewards based on the agent's task performance. However, explicitly defining a reward function that accurately approximates human preferences is challenging. Therefore, RLHF seeks to train a \"reward model\" directly from human feedback. The reward model is first trained in a supervised manner to predict if a response to a given prompt is good (high reward) or bad (low reward) based on ranking data collected from human annotators or other pre-trained models. This model then serves as a reward function to improve an agent's policy through an optimization algorithm like proximal policy optimization.\n","RLHF has applications in various domains in machine learning, including natural language processing tasks such as text summarization and conversational agents, computer vision tasks like text-to-image models, and the development of video game bots. While RLHF is an effective method of training models to act better in accordance with human preferences, it also faces challenges due to the way the human preference data is collected. Though RLHF does not require massive amounts of data to improve performance, sourcing high-quality preference data is still an expensive process.
